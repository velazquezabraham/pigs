Hmm, it appears that you have multiple definitions of functions. This
can occur if you inadvertently #include a .cpp file where you should
only be #including .h files. Sure enough, in the file cpigplayer.cpp I
found this statement:

  #include "cdie.cpp"

Whoops! That pulls in the C++ implementation code into the cpigplayer.cpp
file, but you're already compiling and linking cdie.cpp into the project,
so the linker sees the CDie functions twice, which causes the multiple
definitions error message. You should only #include .h files, which should
only contain code that doesn't allocate space in memory (such as functions).
Once I removed the #include of cdie.cpp from the file cpigplayer.cpp, your
code built to completion without errors.

The user should be able to just press the 'Enter' key alone to
continue rolling, it looks like you still need to figure that one out...

Your formatting is okay overall, although you still have problems with
ameeting the CSG rules, particularly with regards to whitespace.

In your function implementations there isn't any internal
documentation for your code. Something of this size and complexity
really needs to be thoroughly documented wih proper function headers
and embedded comments.

Aside from the 'Enter' key not responding on input, the runtime
behavior of your program is fine, it seems to be doing what it's
supposed to be doing. Congratulations on getting this up and running!
